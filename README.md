News Summary APP

## User Stories ##
As a user,  
So I know about the latest stories,  
I want to see all the headlines in one place.

As a user,  
So I can get a brief overview of a story,  
I want to see a summary when I click the headline.

As a user,  
So that I can get a full understanding,  
I want a click to the original story.

As a user,  
To keep me engaged,  
I want to see pictures relating to the headlines.

As a user,  
So I can see the news on the go,  
I want to view the site properly on my phone.

## Plan ##

When site is loaded a call is made to the guardian api  

the response to this is formatted and the top ten headlines are displayed on the page   

when the user clicks on the headline a call is made to the summary api to summarise the article; this is displayed on the page without a refresh
